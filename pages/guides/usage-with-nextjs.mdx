# Setting up Next.js with Renderlesskit

First let's create a new Nextjs project.

```bash
npx create-next-app my-website
```

## Setup TailwindCSS

To get started with renderlesskit first step is to setup Tailwind CSS in your
CRA project. Refer to tailwind documentation for
[Setting up Tailwind CSS in a Next.js project](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs)

After setting up tailwind in your project, all you need to do inside your
`tailwind.config.js` is import our `preset` function and use it.

```js
module.exports = preset({
  presets: [require("@renderlesskit/react-tailwind/preset")],
  purge: [
    // Make sure to add this purge to generate the component's default styling
    "node_modules/@renderlesskit/react-tailwind/**/*",
  ],
});
```

<Callout>
  `presets` merges your taiwind config with renderlesskit's internal tailwind
  configs and enables certain plugins
</Callout>

## Renderlesskit Setup

After following all the steps and correctly setting up tailwind, now let's add
the `RenderlesskitProvider`

Follow [Setting Up Provider](/docs/getting-started#setting-up-provider) to setup
the provider for your app.

Follow [Extending Theme Tokens](/docs/theming#extending-theme-tokens) to extend
your theme tokens with your own custom tokens.

Follow [TypeScript Guide](/guides/typescript-guide) for more information on how
to use along with TypeScript in your app.
