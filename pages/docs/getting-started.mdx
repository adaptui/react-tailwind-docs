# Getting Started

AdaptUI uses tailwind to provide better styling at one place, so you'll need to
setup a tailwind project using their
[installation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) guide.

Installation can be done in three steps

## 1. Installation

You can either install with NPM or Yarn

<Nextra.Tabs items={['NPM', 'Yarn']} defaultIndex={1}>
  <Nextra.Tab>

    ```bash
    npm install @adaptui/react-tailwind
    ```

  </Nextra.Tab>
  <Nextra.Tab>

    ```bash
    yarn add @adaptui/react-tailwind
    ```

  </Nextra.Tab>
</Nextra.Tabs>

## 2. Modifying `tailwind.config.js`

Once you're done with the above steps `@adaptui/react-tailwind` , import our
custom tailwind `preset` inside `tailwind.config.js` and use it.

```js
module.exports = {
  presets: [require("@adaptui/react-tailwind/preset")],
  content: [
    ...,
    // Make sure to add this purge to generate the component's default styling
    "node_modules/@adaptui/react-tailwind/**/*",
  ],
});
```

</Nextra.Callout>

## 3. Wrap your entire app with `AdaptUIProvider`

AdaptUI needs to pass down all the neccesary styling for the components. So you
just have to wrap your entire app inside the provider.

Go to the root of your application and add the below code. Root of your app
might be `App.js` or `App.tsx` or `index.js` based on your project setup.

```js filename="App.js" /AdaptUIProvider/2-3 {2}
import * as React from "react";
import { AdaptUIProvider } from "@adaptui/react-tailwind";

function App() {
  return (
    <AdaptUIProvider>
      <App />
    </AdaptUIProvider>
  );
}
```
